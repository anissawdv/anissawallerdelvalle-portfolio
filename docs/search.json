    "text": "Load the needed packages. For this assignment, I used the dslabs package, the tidyverse package, and the ggplot2 package.\nlibrary(\"dslabs\") \nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nRunning the next command in the R console to seek information/assistance on gapminder.\nhelp(gapminder)\nThe str() function in R is short for structure. Running this command enables users to display the internal structure of an R object. I will run this command to display the structure of the gapminder dataset.\nstr(gapminder)\nThe summary command in R produces summary statistics for a given dataset or vector. I will obtain a summary of the data.\nsummary(gapminder)\nThe class() function in R determines the class (i.e., data type or structure) of an object. I will determine the type of object gapminder is.\nclass(gapminder)\nI will write code that assigns only the african countries to a new object called africadata.\nafricadata &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% \n+ filter(continent == \"Africa\")\n\n&lt;- is an assignment operator. It will assign the filtered data to a new object, which I have named africadata.\ngapminder is the dataset being used. %&gt;% is a pipe operator. It will take the output of one function and use it as the input to the next function.\nfilter() is a function that selects a subset of rows from a dataset that met specific conditions. It is part of the tidyverse collection.\ncontinent == “Africa” is the condition being used inside filter(). It will keep rows where the continent coloumn is equal to “Africa”. Africa must be in quotes because it is a text string.\n\nI will check the new data set using the str and summary functions.\nstr(africadata) \nsummary(africadata)\nI confirmed there are now 2,907 observations. Now, I will take the africadata object and create two new objects. One object will contain infant_mortality and life_expectancy data. The other will contain population and life_expectancy. I should have two objects with 2,907 observations and two variables.\nI will generate an object with only infant_mortality and life_expectancy\nafrica_infantmort_lifeexp &lt;- africadata %&gt;% \n+ select(infant_mortality, life_expectancy)\n\nstr(africa_infantmort_lifeexp) \nsummary(africa_infantmort_lifeexp)\n\nafrica_infantmort_lifeexp will be the new object with only infant_mortality and life_expectancy.\n&lt;- is an assignment operator and will assign the filtered data to the new object, africa_infantmort_lifeexp.\nafricadata is the dataset being used.\nselect() is a function that will grab a specific coloumn(s) from a dataset, enabling users to create a new dataset that contains only the columns selected.\n\nI have confirmed that the above dataset, africa_infantmort_lifeexp, has 2,907 observations of 2 variables. I will now repeat the process described above to generate the second object with population and life_expectancy\nafrica_pop_lifeexp &lt;- africadata %&gt;% \n+ select(population, life_expectancy)\n\nstr(africa_pop_lifeexp) \nsummary(africa_pop_lifeexp)\nI have confirmed that the above dataset, africa_pop_lifeexp, has 2,907 observations of 2 variables.\nI will now plot life expectancy as a function of infant mortality. I expect to see a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nggplot(africa_infantmort_lifeexp, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) + \n+ geom_point() + \n+ labs( + title = \"Life Expectancy vs Infant Mortality in Africa\", \n+ x = \"Infant Mortality\", \n+ y = \"Life Expectancy\" + \n)\n\nggplot() is a function used to initialize a plot object. components must be added using the + operator.\nafrica_infantmort_lifeexp is the dataset I want to plot.\naes() is a function that links data variables to aesthetics, like the x and y position on a graph.\ngeom_point() is a function used to add individual points to a plot.\nlabs() is a function used to modify various labels of a plot.\n\n\n226 rows containing missing values or values outside of the scale range were removed.\nI have plotted life expectancy as a function of infant mortality. I saw a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nI will now plot life expectancy as a function of population size. in this plot, the x-axis will be set to log scale.\nggplot(africa_pop_lifeexp, aes(x = population, y = life_expectancy)) \n+ geom_point() \n+ scale_x_log10() \n+ labs( title = \"Life Expectancy vs Population in Africa\", x = \"Population (log scale)\", y = \"Life Expectancy\" )\n\nscale_x_log10() is a function that transforms the x-axis of a plot to a base-10 logarithmic scale.\n\n\n51 rows containing missing values or values outside of the scale range were removed.\nI have plotted life expectancy as a function of population size. I saw a positive correlation between population size and life expectancy.\nIn both plots, there are ‘streaks’ of data. I believe that this due to the fact that I am looking at data for each individual country in africa over several decades (1960 - 2016).\nAs mentioned previously, 226 rows containing missing values or values outside of the scale range were removed from the first plot looking at life expectancy as a function of infant mortality. I will now figure out which years have missing data for infant mortality.\nafricadata %&gt;% \n+ group_by(year) %&gt;% \n+ summarise(missing_infant = sum(is.na(infant_mortality))) %&gt;% \n+ arrange(year)\n\nafricadata is the dataset that will be used.\ngroup_by() is a function that organizes data into groups. I will group the data by year.\nsummarise() is a function that summarizes a dataset into a single value.\nis.na() is a function that identifies missing values in an object. Here, the object is infant_mortality.\nsum() is a function that adds the number of true values. This will count the number of countries in africa that are missing infant data mortality for each year.\nmissing_infant is the name given to the column that will store the counts obtained from the sum(…) function.\n\nI currently only see the first 10 rows. To see the rest, I will first make missing_infant an object, and then print all rows.\nmissing_by_year &lt;- africadata %&gt;% \n+ group_by(year) %&gt;% \n+ summarise(missing_infant = sum(is.na(infant_mortality))) %&gt;% \n+ arrange(year)\nI can see that all countries in Africa reported infant mortality between the years 1982 - 2015. I will now take a look at data from the year 2000 only. I expect to end up with 51 observations and 9 variables.\nafrica_yr2000 &lt;- africadata %&gt;% \n+ filter(year == 2000)\n\nstr(africa_yr2000) \nsummary(africa_yr2000)\nI can see 51 observations of 9 variables. I will now make the same plots as above again, this time for the year 2000. I expect to see a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy.\nggplot(africa_yr2000, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) + \n+ geom_point() + \n+ labs( + title = \"Life Expectancy vs Infant Mortality in Africa (2000)\", \n+ x = \"Infant Mortality\", \n+ y = \"Life Expectancy\" + \n)\n\nI will now make the same plots as above again, this time for the year 2000. I expect to see no noticeable correlation between population size and life expectancy.\nggplot(africa_yr2000, aes(x = population, y = life_expectancy)) + \n+ geom_point() + \n+ scale_x_log10() + \n+ labs( + title = \"Life Expectancy vs Population in Africa (2000)\", \n+ x = \"Population (log scale)\", \n+ y = \"Life Expectancy\" + \n)\n\nI will fit a linear model to this data. I will fit life expectancy as the outcome and infant mortality as the predictor. I will save the result into an object and view the results of this model.\n\nlm() is a function used to fit linear models.\nThe output is on the left-hand side of ~.\nThe predictor is on the right-hand side of ~.\ndata = africa_yr2000 is the dataset being used. fit1 is the name of the object being created.\n\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africa_yr2000) summary(fit1)\nThe y-intercept of the regression line is 71.29331. This is the predicted value of life expectancy when infant mortality = 0. The slope is -0.18916. Life expectancy decreases by 0.18916 years with each infant mortality. The slope is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). In sum, this means there is a strong negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy, with high infant mortality predicting low life expectancy.\nI will now repeat with population size as the predictor variable and life expectancy as the outcome.\nfit2 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ population, data = africa_yr2000) summary(fit2)\nThe y-intercept of the regression line is 55.93. This is the predicted value of life expectancy when population = 0. The slope is 2.756e-08. Life expectancy increases by 2.756e-08 years with each additional person. The slope is not statistically significant. Put together, this means that population size is not a predictor of life expectancy in the year 2000 for countries in Africa."

    "text": "Background and Training\nMy name is Anissa Waller Del Valle. I am Ph.D. student in the Department of Cellular Biology and member of the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD) here at the University of Georgia. I obtained a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from Clemson University and was a member of the Eukaryotic Pathogens Innovation Center (EPIC).\nResearch Interests\nI am interested in parasitology, drug discovery, and molecular and cellular biology.\nMy research aims to evaluate and optimize current therapeutics for Naegleria fowleri, a pathogenic free-living amoeba that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is a rare but rapidly progressing central nervous system infection associated with a fatality rate exceeding 97% and a median time from symptom onset to death of 5 days. Treatment of PAM currently depends on a multidrug regimen comprising up to 7 antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiparasitic agents, largely empirically selected based on their use against other infections rather than on systematic evidence demonstrating efficacy against N. fowleri infection in vitro or in vivo. Ultimately, I hope that this work can inform more effective treatment strategies for patients facing this disease.\nExperience\nI have some experience with R, particularly in assessing dose-response data and drug-drug interactions. So far, I have only worked on analyzing the effects of two-drug combinations and am hoping to learn how to analyze and model complex datasets more rigorously so I can better evaluate the drugs in the current PAM treatment regimen and identify combinations with the greatest potential to improve patient outcomes.\nFor this exercise, I would like to share SynergyFinder Plus, a tool desgined to analyzed drug combination dose-response matrix data.\nOther\nI am a big Star Wars fan – so much so that my cat’s name is Padme Catmidala (Waller Del Valle)."
